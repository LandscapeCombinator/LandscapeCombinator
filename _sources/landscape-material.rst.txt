Landscape Material
==================

There is a landscape material ``M_Landscape`` (instance ``MI_Landscape``) in the plugin that has the following features:

* Au auto layer called ``Mix`` (with adjustable snow, grass, cliff, and road materials).
* Adjustable height above which there is snow instead of grass.
* The cliff material goes on slopes which are steeper than a certain threshold.
* Support satellite images (other any kind of image) overlayed on your landscape, with a camera distance fade.
* You can tint the materials with custom colors, and adjust saturation and brightness.
